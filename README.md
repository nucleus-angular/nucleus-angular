# Nucleus Angular
Nucleus Angular is a collection of angular components that I have found a need for but could not find a 3rd party implementation that I liked.  This repository's primary purpose is to create a simple way to be able to include all the components of Nucleus Angular through incliding one bower package.  If you only need a few components, you should included them individually however if you want/need them all or most of them, just include this package with bower using the package name ```nucleus-angular```.

If you have any bugs or suggestions for any of the components, please enter them in there individual repository (each component has it's own github repository).

# Recommended 3rd Party Components

While I am sure a lot of the components in this collection have other implementations, this collection will not contain a components for everything.  This is a list of recommended 3rd party components that compliment Nucleus Angular well.  From time to time I might find a 3rd party component that is a lot better than what this collection has implemented and will stop development on that component and remove it from the main `nucleus-angular` package.  I will make a judgement call on whether or not to keep the the replaced component installable through bower for a period after (though the repository on github will always remain up for quite a while).  Anything in this list that has replaced an old component that is still installable through bower will display the package name in parantheses.
